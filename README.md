## booknook cafe's survey form

as part of my journey doing [freeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/), i had to create a basic survey form. i decided to make it prettier, and also use it to practice both my html and css skills! ◝(ᵔᗜᵔ)◜

### project overview .ᐟ
‘survey-form’ is a mock-up for a cafe’s customer feedback form.
if you locally host ‘index.html’, you’ll see live styling, layout, and interactive form questions.
BUT, social links (instagram, website) are **not yet functional** ( ꩜ ᯅ ꩜;)⁭ ⁭(stay tuned! i am planning to build out the full site!)
you can also find a menu pdf i designed on canva pro under the ‘documents/’ folder 

### usage .ᐟ
clone or download the repository.
open ‘index.html’ in your browser.

### status .ᐟ
definitely planning to revisit ‘survey-form’! it’ll keep getting better as i learn more (˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶)
